This project contains ScalaJS facades for [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) itself.

It is a work in progress, but it is already usable for some basic tasks.

It depends on:
* [Scala 3](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/) for compile-time metaprogramming and [ScalaJS](https://www.scala-js.org/) for client-side rendering.
* [Laminar](https://laminar.dev)
